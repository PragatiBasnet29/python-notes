# Python Notes Repository

This repository provides a collection of Jupyter notebooks that cover fundamental and intermediate concepts in Python programming. Each notebook explores specific topics, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced subjects like functions, exception handling, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

## Contents

### 1. Basic Python Concepts
   - **basicPython1.ipynb**: Introduces Python syntax, variable assignment, data types, and basic operations.
   - **basicPython2.ipynb**: Expands on control flow in Python, including if-else statements, loops, and logical operators.
   - **basicPython3.ipynb**: Covers Python data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, including basic manipulations and common methods.

### 2. Functions in Python
   - **pythonFunctions1.ipynb**: Discusses the creation and use of functions, parameter passing, return values, and local vs. global scope.
   - **pythonFunctions2.ipynb**: Delves into more advanced topics in functions, including lambda functions, map/filter, recursion, and higher-order functions.

### 3. Exception Handling
   - **pythonException.ipynb**: Provides an overview of Python's exception handling with try-except blocks, common exceptions, and best practices for error handling in Python programs.

### 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - **pythonOOP1.ipynb**: Introduces the principles of OOP in Python, including classes, objects, attributes, and methods.
   - **pythonOOP2.ipynb**: Explores advanced OOP concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and special methods (dunder methods).

## Usage

To use these notebooks:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local environment:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Install Jupyter Notebook** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```
3. **Open the notebooks** by navigating to the folder and starting the Jupyter Notebook server:
   ```bash
   cd python-notes-main
   jupyter notebook
   ```

Each notebook can be opened and executed individually to practice and learn each topic in an interactive environment.
